# Vulkan tutorial but in Rust. Why? Why not?
I'm simply trying to replicate the [Vulkan tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/) here as it's presented, but in Rust. Why? Why not? 

There are better ways to write this code, but I've made it as close to the current Vulkan tutorial syntax as possible just to be able to compare the instructions side by side and how Rust behaves as it deals with C directly.

I plan to do it more in the Rust style later.
